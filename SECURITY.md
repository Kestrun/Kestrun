## Reporting a Vulnerability

We will review and respond as quickly as possible.
If the issue is confirmed, we will work on a fix and coordinate a release.
Credit will be given to the reporter if desired.

## Disclosure Expectations

- You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within **72 hours**.
- We aim to provide a resolution or mitigation within **30 days**.
- Please refrain from publicly disclosing the issue until we have released a fix.
